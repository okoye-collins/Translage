Properties Of Evaluation Instruments

Evalution is quantitative as well as qualitative in nature and uses a wide variety of evaluation tools to archive its purpose.

Properties Of Evaluation Instruments
Commonly accepted qualities of good evaluation tools.
- Validity
- Reliability
- Objectivity
- Adequacy
- Discrimimnation Power
- Practicability
- Comparability
- Utility

i) Validity
- The validity of a test may be defined as the accuracy with which the test measures what it purports to measure.
- According to Garrett, “ The validity of a test depends upon the fidelity with which it measures what it intends to measure”
- Every test is contructed for some specific purpose and it is valid only for that purpose.
Types Of Validity
* Face Validity: It implies that a test measures superficially what the test-maker desires to measure, and not what it actually measures. This type of validity has very little significance.
* Content Validity: It refers to the degree to which a test sample the content area which is to be measured.
* Predictive Validity:  It refers to the extent to which a test can predict the future performance of individuals.
* Concurrent Validity:  It refers to the relationship between scores on a measuring tool and a criterion available at the same time. The concurrent validity differs from predictive validity only on time dimension.
* Construct Validity: It refers to the extent to which a test reflects, contructs presumed to underlie the test performance and also the extent to which it is based on theories regarding these constructs.
Method Of Determining Validity Of A Test
Method Of determing validity of an achievement test are:
- Correlating it with another test
- Correlating with teacher rating
- Item Analysis

ii) Reliability
- Reliability of a test is the consistency with which the test measure whatever it does measure.
- A reliability test is a thrust worthy test
- A reliability test should yield essentially the same (or almost same) score when administered a second time to the people, provieded no learning or forgetting has taken place between the periods of the two testing.
- The degree of reliability is usually denoted by a cofficient of correlation / reliability coefficient.

Reliability depends on the following factors:
    • Appropriateness and definiteness of the task
    • Consistency, stability, alertness state of the people who takes the test.
    • Consistency and objectivity of the scorer of the test
